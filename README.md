# Parallel-Programming-Assignment

1. Write a C program to create a single child process using fork-join (fork ()) structure. Find process id of parent and child process at the calling of fork() system call.
 
2. Write a C program to implement multiple child processes under one parent process using for loop in C.

3. Implement a code to create two children using a separate user defined function called “createChild()”. Call the “createChild()” in main function. 

4. Consider following instructions  
a=1+2  
b=4*5  
z=a*2  
c =a+b+z 
Implement a C code using fork-join to calculate the value of c. 

5. Implement a C code for addition of elements in two array with equal size using fork () system calling. 
Ex : a = [1,2,3,5] 
b = [7,8,9,7] , then result of 
a + b = c [8,10,12,12] 

6. Write a C program to print elements in two arrays in separate processes using fork () system calling.
